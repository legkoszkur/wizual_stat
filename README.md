# Program to data visualisation 


## Goals
My main goal was to learn how build desktop application. 
During work on this project I learned basics of tkinter and matplotlib libraries.

Moreover, working on this project has broadened my point of view in building applications.

## Challenges

On my way, I encountered challenges such as:
1. Unreadable code (after breaks)
2. Meany python errors (especially on the beginning)
3. Some technical problems (laptop memory accident)
4. Stagnation in the project (especially on the end)

## Results

In response to the challenges associated with the project, I expanded my knowledge to such issues as:

1. PEP8 coding standards , OOP paradigm
2. Fast collecting useful informations from the internet
3. Use GIT repositories as safe and efficient space to work on project.
4. Understanding the issues of SCRUM and AGILE in the context of project work and management.

## Final word

Some of the knowledge gained during the project was not fully implemented in it. This was due to the fact that some parts were written much later than others. In addition, I didn't want to stop at this project as I achieved my goals much more than I had initially assumed.

## Technical issues 

The project was implemented between 01.10.2020 to 17.01.2021.
